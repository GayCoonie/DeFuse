# DeFused
### Fusion Jokers... without the fusion

### - Now Includes the jokers from Fusion Jokers 2. [Original](https://ptb.discord.com/channels/1116389027176787968/1227317656131211284/1241331034054725674) 

### - Also now included jokers from Jestobiology. I made a change to the Typography joker to be common and rare,and I excluded the Codex Aranum jokers just for now. [Original](https://github.com/spikeof2010/Jestobiology)

To install, just download the zip with the green code button on the top right.

All credit goes to [itayfeder](https://github.com/stars/itayfeder) and [Lyman](https://github.com/spikeof2010) for all of the actual jokers and code. I just did some find and replace and deletion to get them working without a fusion system. As for why, well that's just my own weird taste.

Very little testing has been done. Let me know if there's any issues, or if the rarities I have set seem off.

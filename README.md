# DeFused
### Fusion Jokers... without the fusion

To install, just download the zip with the green code button on the top right.

All credit goes to [itayfeder](https://github.com/stars/itayfeder) and [Lyman](https://github.com/spikeof2010) for all of the actual jokers and code. I just did some find and replace and deletion to get them working without a fusion system. As for why, well that's just my own weird taste.

Very little testing has been done. Let me know if there's any issues, or if the rarities I have set seem off.
